# Arctic_Sea_Ice_Extent

Frozen ocean water that forms, grows, and melts in the ocean is referred as “Sea Ice”. 
Satellites measure extent more accurately than other measurements, which is why scientists focus more on this measure.

SEA ICE EXTENT=> It measures the area of ocean which meets threshold of minimum concentration to mark ice edge. 15% is the cutoff used by scientists as it provides the most consistent agreement between satellite and ground observations.

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?

	The bright surface of sea ice reflects 80% of the sunlight back into space. Melting of sea ice exposes dark surface of ocean leading to 90% absorption of sunlight instead of reflection. As a result, oceans are heating up further and Arctic temperatures keep rising.

	Thickness and extent of summer sea ice in Arctic have hugely declined in last thirty years. A slight increase in temperature at poles leads to greater warming than imagined. This can dramatically accelerate global warming trends and change climate patterns.

	Much more Arctic ice remains through the summer months than Antarctic ice, reflecting sunlight and cooling the planet. This difference is essentially due to geographical locations. Antarctica being surrounded by water is isolated from global weather patterns compared to Arctic which is surrounded by land making it more sensitive to changes in climate.

CLAIM => “There is no time to deny global warming’s existence but working on solutions”

AUDIENCE: Primary-> Global Warming Deniers.

Also in Focus-> Government, corporations (which are directly affecting environment) and public.

My aim through this project is to throw light on how the data is being misrepresented to hide the real facts. After proving that global warming is in fact a problem, I will suggest actions that could be taken to prevent further damage.

YEARLY SEA ICE EXTENT:

The following visual shows how the change in range used for “sea ice extent” affects the mindset of audience.
Looking at first graph anyone would depict that sea ice extent has been constant for past few decades. But when we closely analyze the sea ice extent, we see that it has seen drastic changes and has been dropping every year.

MONTHLY SEA ICE EXTENT:

Similarly, below visual shows the comparison between monthly sea ice extent over years. Same dataset has been used, same parameters have been taken. Only the difference between colors is enough to deceive the audience and cover the change in sea ice extent over past years.

NEEDS/ WANTS/ FEARS ANALYSIS

Global warming requires significant modifications in the way we all have been leading our lives. Global warming can be caused by activity as small as driving car to as big as opening an industry. 
Various facts have been presented by scientists, various measurements have been compared over years, changes in climate (like unseasonal raining, sudden floods, hurricanes, droughts etc.) have been observed at many places. Still everyone has repeatedly managed to oversee this global issue. Many political parties have very conveniently denied the facts presented by scientists and cleared their hand from this huge responsibility just to gain profits from few industries such as petroleum. If scientists could be proven wrong who else stands a chance?

Need of the time is to save our resources. If we keep overusing resources on the current rate, they’ll extinct soon. Apart from that, environmental safety is very important to ensure our own safety. Whatever we are doing to environment will get back to us.
It is important to match the needs with the wants of our audience to form a connection and provide solution based on what they are actually interested in and what do they care about. Hence the wants of our audience are health, luxury and safety of our next generation. 
By understanding the fears, we will be able to relate it back to wants and suggest actions. Loss of life due to drastic climate change, food scarcity leading to terrorism in various countries are few of the fears.

ACTIONS

Make this a priority issue for all countries so that it is addressed before all other issues. Government of all countries need to unite on international level and introduce “Fossil Fuel free country” policy and make it mandatory for all. This will include shifting to electricity cars, adopting alternate renewable energy sources, install solar panels in home & public places, fine particle filtration to prevent pollution from industry and many more.
